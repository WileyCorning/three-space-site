Three Space Lab is an early-stage MIT Media Lab spin out working on VR and AR software solutions for education, training, and workplace learning, with a focus on uses of interactive simulation. Some previous projects have focused on electricity and magnetism, crystalline structures, 3D scanning, and tools for visual design of brands.

We are math and physics geeks with an artsy side (dance, drawing, music), and we welcome people of any gender, race, ethnicity, color, ability, class, religion, culture, or nationality. We believe that working with people who have diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds enhances our ideas, enriches our lives as individuals and as a team, and is invaluable for understanding how we can best have a positive impact.
